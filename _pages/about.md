I am a Research Assistant Professor at UT Austin, Institute for Geophysics. My research focuses on **AI for Science**, specifically using physics-based solvers, Bayesian optimization algorithms, and developing Multi-modal Transformers (e.g. SourceNet) and Neural Operators to solve complex inverse problems in seismology.

Previously, I was a Green Postdoctoral Scholar at **Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD)** and obtained my Ph.D. from **Caltech**.

I am always keen of applying deep learning to larger-scale physical modeling and inversion.
